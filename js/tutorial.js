As you walk along the banks of the river you feel as you start to lose yourself. Your existence slowly dissapating into nothingness. After a long time you see an old man sitting in the corner. You try to strike up a conversation, but he simply looks at you and asks:\n"First time?".\n"First time what?" you reply.\n"Dying of course. Did you bring any coins?"\n"No..." you stammer out.\n "Well, bring some next time." The man says before suddenly jumping up and hitting you over the head with the blunt end of a stone sickle. Everything fades to black and you hear him whisper "One more Life"',
